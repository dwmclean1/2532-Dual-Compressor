# 2532-Dual-Compressor

## What is it?

This is a dual mono clone of the Urei 1176LN compressor (2 x 1176 = 2532). The main board is a direct copy of the original from the original schematic. The ratio board is taken from the mnats version [seen here](mnats.net/1176_revision_d.html). The meter mode board I designed. It used two DPDT toggle switches, one to chose between displaying output level or gain reduction level and one to bypass the compression path. Stereo link board is also based on the mnats version but combined into one board to save space and wiring. Boards were designed in EagleCAD
